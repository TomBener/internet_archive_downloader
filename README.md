# Internet Archive Downloader

In [Internet Archive](https://archive.org), Some books can be borrowed to read online for a limited period. The extension will try to download these books.

In [HathiTrust Digital Library](https://hathitrust.org). books with full view permission is also supported.

The extension works by fetching every leaf of a book, constructing a PDF stream on the fly targeting to disk storage. So it can handle books of thousands of leafs easily with little memory.

## What It Can Do
* Download a book as a PDF file with text embedded
* Download a book as a collection of image files (JPEG/PNG) one for each leaf, and the text of the book
* Optional leaf range
* Optional leaf quality
* Download multiple books in parallel

## Usage
### Internet Archive:
In [archive.org](https://archive.org), the availability of books lies in three categories:
1) Lending Library

The extension works with category 1 and 2.

After borrowing a book, two new buttons, "Quality" and "Download", appear under the book viewer alongside the "Favorite" button.

On successful downloads, the book will be returned automatically for availability to other users.

### HathiTrust:
No login, no borrows required. In [hathitrust.org](https://hathitrust.org), for books with full view permission, a new section, "Ayesha", appears above the "Download" section on the left-hand side of the page. The section contains three buttons, "Quality", "Tasks" and "Download".
